# Todo List

*A very basic list that you can add and remove items from.*

## Things to customize
- üíÖ Change the background, and text color
    * [Open configuration](#~/.koji/style.json!visual)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Add your Google Analytics ID and Open Graph information for sharing
    * [Open configuration](#~/.koji/metadata.json!visual)

When you're ready, [deploy your project](#~/.koji/deploy.json!visual) and share it with the world! If you decide you want to change something later, you can always redeploy to update!

## Code structure
You can find the code for the main page [here](#~/frontend/pages/HomePage/index.js).
